            <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm Johnny Addis. I am a dedicated and passionate Computer Science &
                Engineering major at Ohio State University. I am searching for a Summer 2025
                internship. I will be a dedicated, diligent intern and a valuable addition to a team.
                I am completely enthusiastic about the computer science field. I enjoy learning and
                tackling difficult and complex problems. My academic journey and outside interests give
                me a deep appreciation for programming, math, and data analysis.
                Ever since I started my journey in computer science, I've been driven by the desire to
                understand how things work and how they can be improved. Whether it's through
                coding, solving challenging math problems, or analyzing data to uncover hidden
                patterns, I thrive on finding innovative solutions that make sense out of complexity.</p>

            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>This past summer, I was a Digital Banking Intern at CIBC in Chicago. Though based in
                Canada, CIBC is one of the largest Chicago banks. I worked in various roles in analytics
                and product management for CIBC digital banking platforms.—need more detail</p>
                <p>The previous summer I was as software engineering intern at Redwood Logistics—one
                    of the largest logistics firms in the country. At Redwood, I worked with an Agile
                    engineering team on improving the logistics integration platform. I also completed
                    individual projects to reduce AWS database usage and costs, programmed with
                    Node.js and built unit tests using Jest.</p>
